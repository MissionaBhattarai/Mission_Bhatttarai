then  he went to my school and he meet my princple sir and talked about not to repeat in the same class (that is grade 8)cause he konws well me that i am a sensetive child and this will gonna effect on my mind .(in princple sir room )haha  i was standing on one corner crying a lot my prioncple sir looked at me i was not on that mood to look him on his eyes cause i was so afraid then in few mintues he speak "Mission hey boy don't cry" then  i looked at him he is staring at and said"you really wants to study in grade 9??"then i immeditly reply yes sir and he told me that "you have to worked hard  aot  atleat for the pass marks "then i said"ok sir thank you "and with my grandpa i leave and i went to my room i was so happy that i got a golden chance to study in grade 9 .
	
	first day of school(grade 9 ) when i entered in the classroom every one teaches(making fun of  me)me  that i don't have a talented mind and there is no one with me when i need them on that time, at evening i went to my room i cried a lot cause i am so sensetive person small things can easily hurt me and i open my bag take out my book and copy for  study but i didn't capture the things on my mind days goes off 1 st terminal examination came i gave my best and this time also i failed on all subjects except computer science .haha you guys are thinking how he passed in that one subjects all the time rights?? haha let me tell you one things i just love the teacher ohh i mean his teaching experience is so fine i mean so damn good he teaches us in so proper way that the subjects called computer science become my favirote subjects when i went my room i only read computer book and in that 1 st terminal exemination i just topped on that subjects (computer science ) but belive me when you looked my other subjects marks you will litlerly fel sad for me .and on that result day i cried (haha asusel)and one day  i sunddely think about my parents and i relize how hard they are working for me for my better future i realize each and every things that my mom and my dad is working a lot for only me for my education . for my eduction they secifise there happyness they sold a part of land for me and my brother for the better life and happy family  i relize that is all for us .then i decided to work hard on study i study a lot and i in 2nd termininal exemination i passed in all subjects and higest in computer science you guys are thinking are thinking how this can be possible let me tell you one thing that when you known that you fimly is doing a lot of hard work hard then it automatically hit you mimd mind it makes you a bit more mature .taht from that day for me education became my first perioty at the age of 13
